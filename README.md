# CompTIA A+ Study Repository

This repository documents my complete preparation for the CompTIA A+ certification exam.  
The repository is divided into two parts:

- **Theory** — Structured notes, diagrams, and annotated screenshots explaining key concepts.  
- **Practice** — Hands-on labs and mini-projects applying the theory in real-world scenarios.

Together, these materials demonstrate both my technical understanding and my ability to apply knowledge effectively.
