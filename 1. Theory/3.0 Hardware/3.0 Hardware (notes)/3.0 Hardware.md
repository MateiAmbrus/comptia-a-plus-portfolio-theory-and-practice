# 3.1 Display Types & Display Attributes

## Display Types

### LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)

Lights shine through liquid crystals
- Advantages
	- Lightweight
	- Relatively low power
	- Relatively inexpensive
- Disadvantages
	-  Black levels are a challenge
	-  Requires separate backlight
		-  Florescent (old), LED (Light Emitting Diode)
		-  Lights can be difficult to replace

#### LCD technologies

1. TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
	- The original LCD technology (the very first)
	- Fast response time (good for gaming)
	- Poor viewing angles - color shifts

2. IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
	-  Excellent color representation
	-  Can be more expensive to produce than TN
3. VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
	- A good compromise between TN and IPS
	- Good color representation
	- Often slower response times than TN

### OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display

- OLED displays do not have a backlight
- OLED displays have a organic compound that emits light when receiving an electric charge
-  Thinner and lighter
-  Flexible and mobile - no glass needed
-  Great for tablets phones and smart watches
-  Very accurate color representation
-  Tends to be a bit higher cost than LCD

### Mini LED

Mini LED is a type of LCD display that uses thousands of very small LEDs as an advanced backlight system.

- Each LED can be enabled or disabled
- color and intensity can be different
- much better color over dark screen areas
- deeper blacks better color representation

### Digitizers and Touchscreens

#### üîπ **Broad (general) definition**

- A **digitizer** is *any device* that converts **analog (real-world, continuous) information** into **digital (discrete, numeric) data** that a computer can process.

Examples of ‚Äúdigitizers‚Äù in this general sense:

* üé§ A **microphone** digitizes sound waves into digital audio.
* üì∑ A **camera sensor** digitizes light into digital images.
* üñãÔ∏è A **graphics tablet** digitizes hand movements or pen strokes.
* üì° A **scanner** digitizes printed images into digital files.
* üïπÔ∏è Even a **Kinect** (as you mentioned earlier!) digitizes 3D motion into digital position data.

#### üîπ **Narrow (touchscreen-specific) definition**

In touchscreen or pen-input contexts, the word *‚Äúdigitizer‚Äù* has a **specialized meaning**:

- It refers specifically to the **touch-sensing layer** of a display or tablet that converts **finger or stylus movement** into **digital coordinates** that the device can process.

That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs most often used in consumer electronics (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.).

#### üîπ **Both perspectives**

| Context                     | What ‚Äúdigitizer‚Äù means                 | Example                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **General (technical)**     | Any device that turns analog ‚Üí digital | Microphone, camera, Kinect |
| **Specific (touchscreens)** | Touch or pen input sensor layer        | iPad or Surface digitizer  |


### Backlight and inverter

#### Backlight
- LCD displays use backlights such as:
	- florescent
	- LED lights

#### Inverter

Fluorescent-backlit LCD displays require an inverter to convert low-voltage DC power into high-voltage AC to operate the CCFLs, whereas modern LED-backlit LCDs don‚Äôt need an inverter, as LEDs run directly on low-voltage DC.

### Troubleshooting

- To verify backlight 
	- look at the screen closely
	- use a flashlight to luminate the screen
	- texture graphics on the screen that are faint indicate a problem with the backlight

- In case of issues we either replace the dislay or the LCD inverter 

## Display Attributes

### Pixel density (PPI or PPcm)

Pixel density is measured in PPI (Pixel Per Inch) or PPcm (Pixel Per Centimeter)

A higher pixel density means a higher clarity and sharpness of the image. 

#### Printers

For printers there is DPI (Dots per inch) which determines how many dots can be represented on a inch of paper.

To calculate the pixel density we divide the horizontal pixels (only one line not all) to the width of the screen (in inches or in cm).

- Example: 
	- 24 inch (wide) 4K display
	- 3840 horizontal pixels / 24 inches = 160 PPI

### Refresh rates

Refresh rate is the number of times per second a display or monitor redraws or updates the image on the screen, measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher refresh rate means the screen updates more frequently, resulting in smoother motion and less flicker.

If a monitor has a refresh rate of 120 Hz that means that the monitor updates it's image 120 times each second.

Higer refresh rate = better picture (but more expensive)

We have to make sure that both the video card and video addapter can support the resolution and the refresh rate we desire.

For example:
 - HDMI 2.1 supports 4K at 144Hz
 - DisplayPort 2.1 supports dual 4K at 144 Hz

### Resolution

Resolution is the number of distinct pixels a display can show, usually expressed as width √ó height.

Width = number of pixels horizontally

Height = number of pixels vertically

Higher resolution = more pixels, resulting in sharper and more detailed images

üí° Simple definition:

Resolution = the total number of pixels a display can show, determining image clarity and detail.

Example:

1920√ó1080 ‚Üí 1920 pixels wide √ó 1080 pixels tall (~2.07 million pixels)

3840√ó2160 ‚Üí 3840 pixels wide √ó 2160 pixels tall (~8.3 million pixels, 4K UHD)

### Color gamut

Color gamut for displays refers to the range of colors a display can reproduce compared to the full range of colors visible to the human eye.

It‚Äôs the set of all colors a screen is capable of showing.

The standards for color gamut are:
- Standard gamut (typical): sRGB, Rec.709
- Wide gamut (modern/professional): Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, Display P3
- Ultra-wide gamut (future/pro-grade): Rec.2020, ProPhoto RGB

![c0a9711af6e45ffdf05df8023780787c.png](../_resources/c0a9711af6e45ffdf05df8023780787c.png)

In the picture above we can se the color gamut specification for 2 displays.

OLED displays are better at color gamut (coler coverage) than LCD displays.
