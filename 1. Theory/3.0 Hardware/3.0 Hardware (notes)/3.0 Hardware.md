#### LCD technologies

1. TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
	- The original LCD technology (the very first)
	- Fast response time (good for gaming)
	- Poor viewing angles - color shifts

2. IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
	-  Excellent color representation
	-  Can be more expensive to produce than TN
3. VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
	- A good compromise between TN and IPS
	- Good color representation
	- Often slower response times than TN

### OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display

- OLED displays do not have a backlight
- OLED displays have a organic compound that emits light when receiving an electric charge
-  Thinner and lighter
-  Flexible and mobile - no glass needed
-  Great for tablets phones and smart watches
-  Very accurate color representation
-  Tends to be a bit higher cost than LCD

### Mini LED

Mini LED is a type of LCD display that uses thousands of very small LEDs as an advanced backlight system.

- Each LED can be enabled or disabled
- color and intensity can be different
- much better color over dark screen areas
- deeper blacks better color representation

### Digitizers and Touchscreens

#### üîπ **Broad (general) definition**

- A **digitizer** is *any device* that converts **analog (real-world, continuous) information** into **digital (discrete, numeric) data** that a computer can process.

Examples of ‚Äúdigitizers‚Äù in this general sense:

* üé§ A **microphone** digitizes sound waves into digital audio.
* üì∑ A **camera sensor** digitizes light into digital images.
* üñãÔ∏è A **graphics tablet** digitizes hand movements or pen strokes.
* üì° A **scanner** digitizes printed images into digital files.
* üïπÔ∏è Even a **Kinect** (as you mentioned earlier!) digitizes 3D motion into digital position data.

#### üîπ **Narrow (touchscreen-specific) definition**

In touchscreen or pen-input contexts, the word *‚Äúdigitizer‚Äù* has a **specialized meaning**:

- It refers specifically to the **touch-sensing layer** of a display or tablet that converts **finger or stylus movement** into **digital coordinates** that the device can process.

That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs most often used in consumer electronics (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.).

#### üîπ **Both perspectives**

| Context                     | What ‚Äúdigitizer‚Äù means                 | Example                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **General (technical)**     | Any device that turns analog ‚Üí digital | Microphone, camera, Kinect |
| **Specific (touchscreens)** | Touch or pen input sensor layer        | iPad or Surface digitizer  |


### Backlight and inverter

#### Backlight
- LCD displays use backlights such as:
	- florescent
	- LED lights

#### Inverter

Fluorescent-backlit LCD displays require an inverter to convert low-voltage DC power into high-voltage AC to operate the CCFLs, whereas modern LED-backlit LCDs don‚Äôt need an inverter, as LEDs run directly on low-voltage DC.

### Troubleshooting

- To verify backlight 
	- look at the screen closely
	- use a flashlight to luminate the screen
	- texture graphics on the screen that are faint indicate a problem with the backlight

- In case of issues we either replace the dislay or the LCD inverter 

## Display Attributes

### Pixel density (PPI or PPcm)

Pixel density is measured in PPI (Pixel Per Inch) or PPcm (Pixel Per Centimeter)

A higher pixel density means a higher clarity and sharpness of the image. 

#### Printers

For printers there is DPI (Dots per inch) which determines how many dots can be represented on a inch of paper.

![7771f7db19817b5b078f8c47fc27530e.png](../_resources/7771f7db19817b5b078f8c47fc27530e.png)

To calculate the pixel density we divide the horizontal pixels (only one line not all) to the width of the screen (in inches or in cm).

- Example: 
	- 24 inch (wide) 4K display
	- 3840 horizontal pixels / 24 inches = 160 PPI
 
![70cba7c48074db192401a007f718fc4f.png](../_resources/70cba7c48074db192401a007f718fc4f.png)

### Refresh rates

Refresh rate is the number of times per second a display or monitor redraws or updates the image on the screen, measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher refresh rate means the screen updates more frequently, resulting in smoother motion and less flicker.

If a monitor has a refresh rate of 120 Hz that means that the monitor updates it's image 120 times each second.

Higer refresh rate = better picture (but more expensive)

We have to make sure that both the video card and video addapter can support the resolution and the refresh rate we desire.

For example:
 - HDMI 2.1 supports 4K at 144Hz
 - DisplayPort 2.1 supports dual 4K at 144 Hz

### Resolution

Resolution is the number of distinct pixels a display can show, usually expressed as width √ó height.

Width = number of pixels horizontally

Height = number of pixels vertically

Higher resolution = more pixels, resulting in sharper and more detailed images

üí° Simple definition:

Resolution = the total number of pixels a display can show, determining image clarity and detail.

Example:

1920√ó1080 ‚Üí 1920 pixels wide √ó 1080 pixels tall (~2.07 million pixels)

3840√ó2160 ‚Üí 3840 pixels wide √ó 2160 pixels tall (~8.3 million pixels, 4K UHD)

![753522e05987cb4c365e5f962597a795.png](../_resources/753522e05987cb4c365e5f962597a795.png)

### Color gamut

Color gamut for displays refers to the range of colors a display can reproduce compared to the full range of colors visible to the human eye.

It‚Äôs the set of all colors a screen is capable of showing.

The standards for color gamut are:
- Standard gamut (typical): sRGB, Rec.709
- Wide gamut (modern/professional): Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, Display P3
- Ultra-wide gamut (future/pro-grade): Rec.2020, ProPhoto RGB

![c0a9711af6e45ffdf05df8023780787c.png](../_resources/c0a9711af6e45ffdf05df8023780787c.png)

![597929c386a452c93b74bc071b01d744.png](../_resources/597929c386a452c93b74bc071b01d744.png)

In the picture above we can se the color gamut specification for 2 displays.

OLED displays are better at color gamut (coler coverage) than LCD displays.


# 3.2 Network Cables

## Twisted Pair Copper Cables

- These are cables where there are pairs of two wires with equal and opposite signals that are twisted around each other
- A pair can be either transmiting or receiving and for that pair one cable sends a positive signal while the other sends a negative signal: Transmit +, Transmit - / Receive +, Receive -
- Twisted-pair wires carry the same signal in the same direction ‚Äî one wire carries the positive version and the other the negative. The receiver measures the difference between them to detect interference.
- In twisted-pair copper cables, the twisted pair wires are twisted a different rates

### Categories for Twisted Pari Copper Cables

#### By Ethernet Standard

- The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard determines what cable type, connectors, and electrical characteristics that are needed for a particular Ethernet signal / Ethernet Standard

Examples of ethernet standards and the minimum cable:
- 10BASE-T ‚Üí Cat3 or better, up to 100 m
- 100BASE-TX ‚Üí Cat5 or better, up to 100 m
- 1000BASE-T ‚Üí Cat5e or better, up to 100 m
- 10GBASE-T ‚Üí Cat6a or better, up to 100 m

#### By shielding

- **Unshelded twisted pair**
	- The most common type of twisted pair cabling
	- No aditional shielding
- **Shielded twisted pair**
	- Additional shielding to protect agains shielding
	- Shielding can be done to each individual pair or to the entire cable
	- Requires the cable to be grounded

- **Abbreviations**
	- U = Unshielded
	- S = Braided shielding
	- F = Foil shielding
- (Overall cable) / (individual pairs)TP
	- On each cable will have a reading that looks like this S/FTP. The first leter tells us the type of shielding for the entire cable. For our example it's Braided shielding. The next 3 letter after the slash tell us the shielding for each individual twisted pair. In our example it's foil shielding. The TP only stands for twisted pair. Other examples: F/UTP, U/STP, S/UTP
 
## Coaxial cables

- Coaxial - two or more forms share a common axis
- There is a wire conductor / inner conductor and an outer shield to protect the signals that are running on that inner wire conductor.
- RG-6 is a type of coaxial cable commonly used for transmitting cable television and satellite signals

## Direct burial STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) cables

- Direct burial STP cables are made to be buried in the ground.
	- Waterproof
	- filled with gel to repel water
	- conduit may not be needed
	-  these are shielded twisted pair which provides grounding, adds strenght and protects agains singal interference

The ground is sometimes called a drain wire.

Image above shows the structuer of a Direct burial STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) cable.


## Plenum / No plenum, and plenum-rated cables

### Plenum / No plenum 

In many commercial buildings, the space above a drop ceiling often contains ductwork for air supply and a large open area where return air flows back to the HVAC system. When this open airspace is used for circulating return air, it‚Äôs called a plenum space; if it isn‚Äôt used for air circulation, it‚Äôs considered non-plenum

![2d67a4c87010250bb87297a8fd1b3f07.png](../_resources/2d67a4c87010250bb87297a8fd1b3f07.png)
Above is an image of non-plenum space

Above is an image of plenum space

### Plenum-rated cable

- Traditional cable is a Polyvinul chloride (PVC) coated cable.

- Plenum-rated cable / Fire-rated cable has either
	- Flourinated ethylene polymer (FEP) coating
	- Low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (low-smoke PVC)
 
- Plenum-rated cable / Fire-rated cables are usually less flexible but are functionally the same as the any Twisted Pair Cable.
